The way of writing numbers in Haskell is very similar to which in mathematics.

The following list gives some basic arithmetic operators in Haskell.

|     |                                    |
| --- | ---------------------------------- |
| `+` | Addition                           |
| `-` | Subtraction (or the negative sign) |
| `*` | Multiplication                     |
| `/` | Division                           |

Replace the missing parts (indicated with `??`) in the following code so it evaluates to `24`. Use parentheses `()` when necessary.
