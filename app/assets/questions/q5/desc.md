Although in most cases, Haskell can infer the type of an expression automatically, the type of an expression can be manually annotated with `::`.

`Bool` stands for the type of Boolean values.

`Int` stands for the type of integers (within a limited range).

`Float` and `Double` stand for the types of approximated real numbers, while `Double` has higher precision.

Replace the missing parts (indicated with `??`) in the following code it can be accepted by the sublimator.

_In Haskell, the first letter of a type name is capitalised_
