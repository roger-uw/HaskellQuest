The (in)equality of two Boolean values or two numbers can be tested with `==`, `/=`, `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=`.

The following list gives the descriptions of the operators above. All of them take two expression of the same type and generate a result of type `Bool`.

|      |                                     |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| `==` | ... is equal to ...                 |
| `/=` | ... is not equal to ...             |
| `>`  | ... is greater than ...             |
| `<`  | ... is less than ...                |
| `>=` | ... is greater than or equal to ... |
| `<=` | ... is less than or equal to ...    |

Replace the missing parts (indicated with `??`) in the following code it evaluates to `True`.

_Actually, `==` and `/=` can be used on any two values of type that supports equality test; `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=` can be used on any two values of type that supports comparison in size_
